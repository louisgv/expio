## Conclusion

If Governance is understood as a generally accepted set of formal and informal rules, norms and principles guiding members of a society in collective action for the purpose of achieving agreed goals, it can hardly be said that GHG exist at all.

There is no doubt that GHG is a complex and confusing landscape, highly flawed as an institutional base for collective action to tackle the broad array of issues comprising global health

How GHG has been problematized should form part of this reflection.

What we have is multiple version of GHG resulting in both conflict and consensus
