## The modern mind
  - Bacon (1627) - Scientific Method and the utopia of Bensalem Going back to as long as 1627, Bacon's works hinted to a society where knowledge is even more valuable than money. As described in his Utopia novel, the state of Bensalem would trade for knowledge around the world (). The technocrat regime.
  - Descartes (1637) further promotes the idea of a redo to science and a need to have a more general Natural knowledge, as he observed that with solid foundation from the beginning, men can build things greater than ever, unprecedented. ()
  - Fuller (2012) further this notion as he discussed the two spectrum of modern politic. We can see the two perspective align with the pre-modern and the modern mindset, whence one seeking actively to prevent and seek safety, the other seek experimenting and the knowledge itself.
