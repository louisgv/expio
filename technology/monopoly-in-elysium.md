# Monopoly and Inequality in Elysium

Elysium delivers both a beautiful cinematic experience, and a strong message on how chaotic the world would be under the presence of space governance monopoly and global health inequality.

There are three problems in the world of Elysium. The first being the lack of a balanced international space governance. The second the lack of human security and global health effort. And lastly, the lack of collaboration and competition between Earth and Elysium.

The lack of a balanced international space governance is depicted by how the world is divided into two "nations" : Earth and Elysium. While Earth is then a devastated desert, Elysium is the perfect human habitat. Throughout the movie, there is no mention of a government focused on Earth problem. Instead, there is a centralized governance resided in Elysium. Observing that all of Earth's problems were ignored such as health-care, environment, and housing, it seems that this world did not came to an agreement of a treaty that balance out the interest and needs of developing nation discussed by Moltz (49). Elysium takes away Earth's resources just to benefit itself.

Similar to Moltz's discussion on how individual contribution brought forth a critical problem to the eyes of major actors (148), the solution Elysium proposed was to have an individual - Max - sacrificing himself to fix the situation by making all citizen on Earth a citizen of Elysium, effectively establishing a global system.

In Elysium, the concept of national health security seems dominant. With the distance between Earth and Elysium acting as the border, the risk of epidemic disease coming from Earth becomes a low priority. Thus, while each and every Elysium household has a med-pot that can cure any disease - even reconstructing a face within minutes - they refuse to bring the technology down to Earth and solve the health problem down there.

It seems that since the problem was not needed to solve, aid were not dispatched. Mcinnes & Lee briefly discussed this (63). Only until the end, when health issue on Earth are merged with Elysium, we have the establishment of global health security in which the robot dispatched med-pod from Elysium to Earth, and cure the sicks. This global health security seems to align with Mcinnes & Lee's discussion on the subject (140).

The lack of the human security that was discussed by Mcinnes C. & Lee K. (68) is shown by the lack of sympathy toward maternal and child health, namely how the mercenary followed his order to attempt murder on both the mom and her sick daughter. Furthermore, the restriction of moving to Elysium revealed the tension between health, foreign policy and the freedom of movement discussed by Mcinnes C. & Lee K. (69)

In the movie, we can clearly observe the majority reason which the citizen of Earth would want a ticket to Elysium, was mainly for the MedPod, for healthcare and treatment. However, we were not provided the thought from the other side. What did citizen and the government of Elysium think these illegal immigrant would do upon entering Elysium? Maybe the message of Donald Trump were encoded into citizen of Elysium's brain?

An interesting observation is that the risk regarding peacekeeping missions discussed by Mcinnes C. & Lee K. were mainly focused on epidemic disease that can transmit from human to human (150). However, at the end of Elysium, we clearly see an army of robot that came down to Earth, with med-pots ready to cure the sick humans. We see these robots produced on Earth, not serving Earth, but flew up to Space to serve the citizen of Elysium. This seems like a big contradiction.
