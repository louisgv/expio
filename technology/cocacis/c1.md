# Getting into Orbit

These points highlight an essential fact about space technology: its dual-use nature.

The real questions are often not technical ones about a spacecraft’s capabilities, but instead political and practical ones: who controls the spacecraft and to what specific use is it being put?

A key takeaway from this brief history isqzz that while the first space powers had to invent all of these technologies, many of them can be purchased today, and that availability has accelerated the growth of spacefaring countries.

## A brief History of space science And technology

### Astronomy (13-14)

3rd century BC: Greek Aristarchus of Samos had conceived of a Suncentric solar system

Johannes Kepler used observations by the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe to prove further that the planets moved in elliptical orbits around the Sun.

Galileo Galilei built on this knowledge to prove the rotation of the planets.

Isaac Newton developed new understandings of gravity and highly accurate laws of motion.
