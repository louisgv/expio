# Summary of Bacon's The Great Instauration

The opening of Bacon's The Great Instauration entails a `visionary plan`.

Bacon began with reasoning why a `total reconstruction` of human knowledge is needed, with a letter to the king requesting to support that cause.

For the preface, after commented how men often "overrate the founding while underrate their strength," Bacon discussed the differences between the `unsteady mechanical arts` and the `immutable intellectual sciences`, how current sciences is more biased opinions but the truth. Bacon then noted at how men needed a better method to uncover more of nature, and how his method will provide generation with `"guidance more faithful and secure."` He moved on with three notes to men: serve God, study nature, and seek knowledge for `"the benefit and use of life."`

Bacon opened the plan with the reason for separating it into parts, which he detailed afterward: The first part summarized contemporary knowledge. The second part derived a better method for studying nature. The third delved into embracing nature and the experience it produces. The fourth discussed the act of giving examples similar to mathematics. The fifth a list of Bacon's discoveries. While the sixth - implementation - won't be in the book as it's a thing both above his strength and beyond his hopes.

Bacon closed with a note at how God's work has been good for all while men's work has always been selfish. The end is a prayer for this plan and the collaboration between men to make life easier with new mercies.
