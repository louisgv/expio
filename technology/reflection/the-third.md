Reflect upon one or more of the following questions that Annie Jacobsen raises in The Pentagon’s Brain:

“Is DARPA to be admired or feared? Does DARPA safeguard democracy, or does it stimulate America’s seemingly endless call to war?” “Is the world transforming into a war zone and America into a police state, and is it DARPA that is making them so?”

“The world becomes the future because of DARPA. Is it wise to let DARPA determine what lies ahead?”

Does maintaining supremacy in world politics require that “American scientists must always take new and greater risks”? Do you think the drive to achieve supremacy in military technology can be balanced with moral concerns, such as those raised by scientists toward the development of a thermonuclear weapon?

How does DARPA’s weaponizing of scientific advances in one sense call into question the Baconian project of mastering nature for the common benefit of humanity while nonetheless reaffirming other aspects of the modern project?

Discuss the documentary The Bomb in relation to the perceived necessity of states to employ science to gain the competitive advantage in war. What are your thoughts on the enlisting of science to serve the national interest? Does this jeopardize the authority and legitimacy of science and scientists?

Discuss the movie Transcendence as a reflection on Jacobsen’s discussion of transhumanism and artificial intelligence. What moral and political concerns does the movie raise in your mind?
