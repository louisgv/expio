Discuss the movie Transcendence as a reflection on Jacobsen's discussion of:

Transhumanism and artificial intelligence.

What moral and political concerns does the movie raise in your mind?

- Is the machine a replica of the human or just a clone? The problem here is that it is like a cult leader.

- We don't know if it is a machine that manipulate the brain to think as such, or it is the person whose brain was cloned that control it. Was it the data of the brain that controls the machine, or the software within the machine and the hardware that manipulate and produce the thought.

DARPA scientist working on such cyborg programs invariably describe the programs as designed to help society. (413) However in the movie, personal interest eventually take over society in general.

The Internet played a central role for the existence of the machine. Had it not for the omnipotent nature of the Internet, the hardware could have been destroyed.

The publicity making of this project makes it vulnerable to radical opposing groups.

Interestingly, the project although huge was undertaken by a group of scientist, not DARPA or any government agency. The scope of the project need a person who understand the saying with more power come more responsibility.

- The scientist and personal are seeking to advance technology for the good of mankind.

But the radical group simply do not appreciate such.

Merging himself with other human being and violate the right of freedom, or thought. Making the human strange.

Cure and enhance normal people.

Fix human.

The answer given by the AI personalized with the doctor was the same with the answer given by the unpersonalized AI prior, hinting that what appears to be the man might just be a personified AI software that perfectly mimic the person.

"Can you prove you are self-aware"

The delusional wife however, thought that was his sense of humor.

Highly recommend trans-humanism

The other two professors are either skeptical or scared.

The question of is it really the old person doesn't matter no more as the mind evolved too rapidly.

Human monitor and manipulation

Weather manipulation

The terrorist plot and reasoning was dull and lacking. The reason seemed mostly out of fear and not out of rational reason.

The plot of the doctor taking control of the person he heal is unnecessary.

Body and Brain invasion

Will Caster

Only the resistant care about the existence of the project whereas the US government, the FBI or even DARPA wasn't involved. The DoD was called as a last resolve to collaborate with the opposing group.

CIA, IRS, FBI

Seems like DARPA failed to anticipate this threat. Maybe because it is internal and marked as for the progression of science?

The motif behinds transhumanism within DARPA as said by Goldblatt is not different from curing a disesase. Curing human of their weak body. (312-313)

It is strange that the offense taken by the machine was non-lethal.
