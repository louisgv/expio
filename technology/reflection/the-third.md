Discuss the movie Transcendence as a reflection on Jacobsenâ€™s discussion of:

Transhumanism and artificial intelligence.

What moral and political concerns does the movie raise in your mind?

+ Is the machine a replica of the human or just a clone? The problem here is that it is like a cult leader.

+ We don't know if it is a machine that manipulate the brain to think as such, or it is the person whose brain was cloned that control it. Was it the data of the brain that controls the machine, or the software within the machine and the hardware that manipulate and produce the thought.

DARPA scientist working on such cyborg programs invariably describe the programs as designed to help society. (413) However in the movie, personal interest eventually take over society in general.

The Internet played a central role for the existence of the machine. Had it not for the omnipotent nature of the Internet, the hardware could have been destroyed.

The publicity making of this project makes it vulnerable to radical opposing groups.

Interestingly, the project although huge was undertaken by a group of scientist, not DARPA or any government agency. The scope of the project need a person who understand the saying with more power come more responsibility.
