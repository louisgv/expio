# Title:

Monopoly in Elysium

# Outline:

## Introduction

- Thesis: **Elysium depicts a world where inequality plagued health care and space governance.**
- Purpose: _Showing how inequality causes imbalance in both health care and space governance, as well as the naive split and focus ideology the movie depicted of human_

## The lack of a balanced Global Governance
Does not seems like a global economy, as the world revolves around two main artifact, the Elysium government, the slum down LA, and between them is Earth.

"Individual contribution" is prominent in this movie, where a certain small group, and a single character has to sacrifice to affect the whole global landscape.

- Politics doesn't give a damn about space, until an individual reported something wrong (148)

But politics ended up making a greater difference. (51) to sell the technology in space. (How the guy were waiting for deal from the government to have himself a deal, even tho he has the power to overthrown )

When it comes to national health security, Elysium seems to depict it well. When the two world are separate into different state/nation, and especially when the risk of spreadable disease is low, the health care concern is only focused per state, locally. They don't even care about sharing technology.

This world seems to have not came to an agreement on a treaty such that an "equitable sharing" of benefits that would take into account the "interests and needs of the developing countries."

## The lack of human security and global health effort

(c3) Maternal and child health (68) -> The lack of sympathy toward maternal and child health in the movie is alarming, how they treat human differently based on status. Two main status, Citizen of Elysium, and Non-Citizen.

Also the lack of sympathy.

(c3) Migration of health care workers (69)

- Reveals two tension concerning health, human rights and foreign policy between the right of freedom of movement and the right to health; and between the promotion for trade interests, especially the promotion of free trade, and the promotion and the protection of rights

The ticket to Elysium is mainly for healthcare and treatment. For the MedPod

Problem with the freedom of movement, where the border is set and negatation of immigration present.

Aid is not related to need (63)

At the end, once the health issues became global health instead of divident between the two kind of people, global health is employed and the issues down Earth was soon tackled by robot.

```
Purpose: Global health is not about the security or stability of the state or any other collective grouping. Rather it is about promoting health, a traditional task of health services nationally but now taken by the WHO onto a global stage with added urgency.  (140)
```

`Risk from certain diseases are believed to affect the willingness of states to send troops on peacekeeping missions. (150)`

Health issues are prioritized into need and so on. Seems like the world of Elysium, the concept of disease on Elysium is not a problem, and thus there was not a need to solve that problem on Earth. Probably to preserve resources, and keeping the wealthier richer.

Homeland security are technocracy robot

## The lack of collaboration or competition between Earth and Space

Commerce in space in the movie seems to be totally abandoned as the Earth is treated as if it is a factory whereas Space is where the it is brought into. Thus, it is not much of a commerce.

Commerce in the movie still remains an untapped region. There is no trading between Earth and Space.

Collaboration in space is the only way to maintain sustainability in space and on Earth.

Military Hegemony

- The rise of various friendly space powers in recent years suggests that it may not be necessary that the US or China would be the only option as a space hegemony.

- It also discounts the possibly important moderating role of new actors, such as private companies and international consorta, which are becoming increasingly influential in affecting space outcomes and are more interested in profits than in power-driven warfare in space.

- Old style hegemonic theories for space-drawn largely from military concepts of previous centuries seem unrealistic.


## Discussion
Reaffirmed that global health diplomacy is not a natural outcome but a way of constructing the world to promote certain agenda, idea and institutions over others. (77)
