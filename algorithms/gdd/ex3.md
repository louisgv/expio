Use of Graph

# Searching Graphs

  Depth First Search
  Breadth First Search

Explain each type
  How does it work?

# Code for searching

  What does your Vertex class need?

  Required data structures for each searching type

# Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

Describe what it does.

# Sorting

## Describe a sorting algorithm you’ve used

  How does it work?

  What is its complexity (big “O” notation)?

## When would you need to sort data?
+ To show the list of highscore sorted from high to low

## Why not just use one sort for everything?
+ Either you care more about the average case performance, or the worst case performance, or the best case performance, depending on how often these cases are achieved with each problem. Also, when space complexity is considered.
