# Pull-up

Muscle groups worked are latissimus dorsi muscle, brachialis muscle, brachioradialis muscle, the biceps brachii, the teres major muscle, the abdominal muscle, pelvic floor muscles and forearm muscles.

* Stronger forearm muscles as well as the brachioradialis muscle improves grip strength and endurance, allowing longer hanging on the wall.
* Stronger latissimus dorsi muscle allows tighter upward pull from the upper arms, making pulling the body up easier.
* Stronger pelvic floor muscles and abdominals muscle allows climber to have more stability while hanging on the wall.
* Stronger biceps allows climber to create tensions which help holding them on the wall.
