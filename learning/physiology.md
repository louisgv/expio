# Pull-up

Muscle groups worked are latissimus dorsi muscle, brachialis muscle, brachioradialis muscle, the biceps brachii, the teres major muscle, the abdominal muscle, pelvic floor muscles and forearm muscles.

* Stronger forearm muscles as well as the brachioradialis muscle improves grip strength and endurance, allowing longer hanging on the wall.

Forearm
The five major forearm muscles: brachioradialis, pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus and flexor carpi ulnaris all get a major workout anytime someone takes to the mountain. Since the muscles in the fingers themselves are very tiny and hard to exercise, the strength it takes to hold you onto the face of a rock are found in the forearm. For this reason, many climbers strengthen their forearms by completing hand exercises. Squeezing a grip bar or small ball several times in the hand will ultimately improve hand, wrist and forearm strength, increasing your endurance and allowing you to stay hugged against the wall tightly.

The forearm flexors are what close the fingers in the hand and allow you to grip the rock face as you palm, pinch or crimp your way to the top. These are the smallest muscles used in climbing but are also the most used. As a result, they have a tendency to fatigue quickly, so climbers spend quite a bit of their training time strengthening their grip. Reducing fatigue, however, mostly comes from improving technique where your hands are not used to pull you up the rock but only to hold you to it as the large muscles of the legs push you up.

Biceps
The biceps in the upper arm are used to flex the lower arm, bringing the wrist toward the shoulder. When used properly, the biceps are used to create tension, similar to an isometric contraction, in the arm to assist in holding the climber to the wall. When used improperly, the biceps are used as the primary pulling muscle that fights gravity to pull the climber upward. Using the biceps in this manner will fatigue them quickly.

Back
The muscles of the upper back, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids and anterior deltoids, are responsible for pulling the upper arms back and down. The latissimus dorsi, or lats, are used to pull the body upward and are primary movers in the pull-up. The rhomboids retract the scapula, or shoulder blades, and are used to help hold the torso in to the rock face. The anterior deltoid is one of three muscles of the shoulder and is used to pull the upper arm back. Collectively, these muscles are used to pull the body up toward the hands and to hold the chest in against the wall.

Abdominals
The abdominal muscles are used primarily as stabilizers when climbing. However, when you start climbing overhangs, the abs are flexed and called into play to keep your legs attached to the rock face. When climbing overhangs, the abs are held in an isometric contraction for long periods of time to keep the pelvis in line with the chest, which will help alleviate the load the forearms, biceps and back must carry.

Legs
The legs are the primary drivers of upward movement in climbing. The four biggest muscles in the front of the thigh, the quadriceps, are used to straighten the lower leg from a bent position as a climber repeatedly does when stepping from hold to hold. The two muscles that comprise the calf, the soleus and gastrocnemius, are used to raise the heel. They are utilized when you stand on your toes to reach for a higher hold and to keep your heel from dropping when you only have your toes or the edge of your foot standing on a thin ledge.



Upper Arms
The ability for a climber to hang by the arm or pull themselves up by the arm when a footing is too small comes mostly from the upper arms and shoulders. These muscles include the bicep in the front of the arm, the triceps behind the arm and the deltoid that wraps around the shoulder. To increase strength in these muscles, many climbers do repetitions of pull-ups. While pull-ups work well to increase strength in the arms, too many repetitions can result in injury. Consider reducing the number of repetitions anytime pain is felt.

Quadriceps
Any seasoned climber knows that, while climbing most certainly does take arm strength, the real strength comes from the legs. Climbers do not use their arms to lift their bodies; the arms are used predominately to stay tight against the mountain. To move up a rock face a climber must use her quadriceps muscles, found in the front of the thighs. Strong quadriceps allows a climber to step up from any precarious angle. Strengthen the quadriceps by doing squats and always taking the stairs, two steps at a time, instead of an elevator.

Calf Muscles
The muscles in the calves, although used less to help a climber step up than the quadriceps, also play a crucial part in climbing. When a wall's face has small nooks and crevices, the calf muscles are what aid you to keep your toe against the wall when only the smallest bit will fit. When it comes time to move upward, it is the calf muscles that allow you to rise to your tip-toes to get a better reach. For the fastest way to increase calf strength, simply rise to the ball of your feet and lower back down several times while standing. It will not be long before you feel the burn. Alternate patterns with feet parallel to each other then turned out. This will change, slightly, the muscles being engaged making you a more well-rounded climber.


Latissimus dorsi muscle: responsible for extension, adduction, transverse extension also known as horizontal abduction, flexion from an extended position, and (medial) internal rotation of the shoulder joint. It also has a synergistic role in extension and lateral flexion of the lumbar spine

Brachialis muscle:flexes the arm at the elbow joint.[1] Unlike the biceps, the brachialis does not insert on the radius, and does not participate in pronation and supination of the forearm

brachioradialis (Venke's muscle) is a muscle of the forearm that flexes the forearm at the elbow. It is also capable of both pronation and supination, depending on the position of the forearm. It is attached to the distal styloid process of the radius by way of the brachioradialis tendon, and to the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus.

The brachioradialis flexes the forearm at the elbow. When the forearm is pronated, the brachioradialis tends to supinate as it flexes. In a supinated position, it tends to pronate as it flexes. This also assists the biceps brachii.
The brachioradialis is a stronger elbow flexor when the forearm is in a midposition between supination and pronation at the radioulnar joint. When pronated, the brachioradialis is more active during elbow flexion since the biceps brachii is in a mechanical disadvantage.
With the insertion of the muscle so far from the fulcrum of the elbow, the brachioradialis does not generate as much joint torque as the brachialis or the biceps. It is effective mainly when those muscles have already partially flexed at the elbow. The brachioradialis flexes the forearm at the elbow, especially when quick movement is required and when a weight is lifted during slow flexion of the forearm.
The muscle is used to stabilize the elbow during rapid flexion and extension while in a midposition, such as in hammering. The brachioradialis is synergistic with the brachialis and biceps brachii; the triceps brachii and anconeus are antagonistic.[2][3]

The teres major muscle (Latin teres meaning 'rounded') is a muscle of the upper limb and one of seven scapulohumeral muscles. It is a thick but somewhat flattened muscle, innervated by the lower subscapular nerve (C5 and C6).

The teres major is a medial rotator and adductor of the humerus and assists the latissimus dorsi in drawing the previously raised humerus downward and backward (extension, but not hyper extension). It also helps stabilize the humeral head in the glenoid cavity.

The abdominal muscles stabilize the torso by connecting the rib cage to the pelvis. The rectus abdominis (along with hip flexors) can generate force to lift the lower body up during kipping, but can also stabilize the front of the pelvis from drifting away from the sternum, just as the erector spinae help to keep the vertebrae from drifting apart in the back. The external and internal obliques perform similar roles on another plane, able to generate or prevent twisting or side-bending, and may help reduce body swinging. The transverse abdominis helps to prevent movement in all directions, encouraging a neutral position.

Pelvic floor muscles hold the organs up and stabilize the pelvis.[18]

The muscles of the forearm are also worked by holding the overall body weight, improving the strength of the fingers and the forearms muscles creating a strong isometric contraction in these muscle groups.
