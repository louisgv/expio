> Problem with my generation

There is lots of problem with generation, and I think the lack of seriousness in real information searching is somewhat lacking, but the generation is fairly young, and they are already adopting latest information. I think once we see them mature a little bit more, we can further adjust our point of view on this lack.

As for the usage of porn and watching porn at young age, I think this is inevitable. If your religious prohibits such act, by no means I respect that. But in an age where information is keys, people wants to understand what their body part is for. And naturally, they will get into that, without even bad influence given a wealth of information we have under our proposal. To put it bluntly, watching porn is just another way of absorbing information. There are the 5% who cannot get out of watching it and indeed turn into the loser you have in mind. But the majority of people who watch porn eventually get tired of watching and instead get inspired to do the real thing, so I think porn is doing us a favor actually. It is more of an educational aspect.

Also, the act of love giving, which is sex and porn in general, I think is harmless, at least when compared to the act of using a gun. I respect those who can persuade a man to drop a gun with resonating words than those who hastily pull the trigger out of fear and illusion. That is not the brave world, but an old and ancient world still struggling with the fear of death. I think once immortality is achieved and widespread, we will see the bigger picture unfold, where human will actually appreciate the more mature way of acting.

You can say that the Americans have been enduring for this moment where Trump says it all, but the dangerous is that we are seeing the endurance that lasted only for 20 years max. This is not endurance at all as we already observe. The only aspect that Trump does bring up that is actually valuable, is the quantum state he brought up into this political atmosphere. This is true for most political, but extremely true in this case as we have yet to see if the media opinion versus the world and the opinion of the man who sway the biggest country in the world versus reality. We do not have enough data to confirm which one is reality, so let us see what happens.

As an end note, I highly oppose gun possession and any ancient energy usage. The problem with them is that they produce a high amount of unprocessed byproduct. You cannot have clean "coal" or "oil". In order to use them, you must burn them, and the act of burning them, by design as of right now, produce byproduct that can alter human such that we are weaker to cancer.

As for gun versus porn, here is the vulgar question. Would you want to be fucked in the anus, or have a gun point at your anus, and shoot from your anus toward your brain? You can choose to live or to die.

And since I am a pro-life, and pro-immortality person who chose not to be sacrificed for the cause of immortality, but for the cause of innovation in the entertainment and technology industry, I'd choose to live.

The will to live of a person must be held high, for once you die, it is not an experience.
