# Euler Circuit = Plowing the road (Need to go through the path)
+ All vertexes has even  degrees.

# Euler Path
+ Exactly 2 odd degrees

# Handshake
+ Due to the `Handshake Theorem`, there will never be a single odd degree vertex.

# Hamilton Circuit Graph = Deliver the mail (Just need to go to the location)
+ Go to all Vertex Once and End at the Starting Vertex

# Hamiltonian Path
+ Go to all Vertexes Once without Ending at the Starting Vertexes
